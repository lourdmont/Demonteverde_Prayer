        <h1>Adamsonian's Prayer</h1> 
       <center style="color: white;"> 
Dear Lord,
Teach me the things that are important:
To be generous with Your gifts,
Compassionate to those who have less,
        </center>
           <center style ="color:white;">
               Just in the face of unfair circumstances,
True when the world's values contradict my own,
Gracious when things don't go my way,
And magnanimous when they do.
           </center>
 <center style="color: white;"> 
May nothing else matter
Except Faith in Your goodness, my neighbor's, and mine,
Hope that things can get better,
And Charity that always sets things right.
        </center>
        <center style="color: white;"> 
  May Your special Love for the Poor,
The mark of my uniquely Vincentian education,
Be the work I excel in,
The standard I constantly refer to,
And my courage when I meet You someday.
        </center>

O Mary conceived without sin,
Pray for us who have recourse to thee

 St. Vincent de Paul,
Pray for us.
